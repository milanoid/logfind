# logfind
http://projectsthehardway.com/

### The user level features I want for logfind are:

# [ ] I specify what files are important in a ~/.logfind file, using regular expressions.
# [ ] Logfind takes any number of arguments as strings to find in those files, and assumes I mean and. So looking for ‚Äúzed has blue eyes‚Äù means files that have ‚Äúzed AND has AND blue AND eyes‚Äù in it.
# [ ] I can pass in one argument, -o (dash oh) and the default is then or logic instead. In the example above -o would change it to mean ‚Äúzed OR has OR blue OR eyes‚Äù.
# [ ] I want to be able to install logfind on my computer and run it like other projects. However, don‚Äôt push this to PyPI as that‚Äôll really annoy people.
# [ ] Extra bonus points if you can let me specify regular expressions as things to find in files.
# [ ] Finally, speed counts, so whoever can make the fastest logfind will win the prize. The prize is nothing, but you know you want it.

## Project 1: logfind

```bash
$ logfind zedshaw
```
The results of this will be a list of all files that have one instance of the word ëzedshawí in them.
